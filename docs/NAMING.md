# Naming Spitball: Generalized Analysis Framework

> **Status**: `[SPITBALL]` (brainstorming only)  
> **Last Updated**: 2026-01-19  
> **Goal**: Find a short, catchy, playful name for the generalized version of this project.

## 0) Context / Why We're Naming This

Working description (from project intent):

> “I have created a new analysis framework/tool to help me think clearly. It seems useful and hopefully will let me wade through the weaponized information, AI slop, and LLM psychosis traps more successfully. I am generalizing the project.”

We want a name that feels like:
- A **thinking aid** / **analysis assistant** (not a philosophy, not a movement)
- A **protective/clarifying tool** against info hazards (weaponized persuasion, slop, hallucinations)
- **Playful**, **memorable**, **non-cringe**, and **not Rationalist™ coded**

## 1) Naming Brief

### Must-haves
- **Short** (ideally 1–2 words; 2–4 syllables)
- **Easy to say** + easy to type (CLI/package friendly)
- **Neutral-to-playful** tone (not grandiose, not “truth machine”)
- **Extensible**: can name subtools/modules without sounding weird

### Nice-to-haves
- Works as:
  - repo name
  - CLI command (`<name> analyze …`)
  - Python package/module
  - doc title (“<Name> framework”)
- Has an obvious metaphor: **shield / helm / hat / lens / filter**

### Avoid / Caution
- “Rationalist vibe” words (examples): `bayes`, `epistemic`, `lesswrong`, `rational`, `axiom`, `ontology`
- Overclaiming: `truth`, `fact`, `reality`, `proof`, `certainty` (fine in docs; risky in branding)
- Medical/mental-health puns that read as making light of real illness. (We can keep “LLM psychosis” as internal slang, but the outward name should be kind.)

## 2) What Exactly Needs a Name?

Potentially separate names (we can mix “serious framework” + “playful tool”):
- **Repo / umbrella project** (most important)
- **Method/framework name** (used in docs)
- **CLI** (can be playful)
- **Library** (can be boring/clear)

If we want *one* name for everything, it should not be too jokey.

## 3) Metaphor Buckets (for Word-Combos)

### Protection / Defensive clarity
Shield, Aegis, Buckler, Helm, Visor, Goggles, Guard, Firewall, Umbrella

### Filtering / Separation
Sieve, Sifter, Strainer, Filter, Decanter, Winnow, Chaff, Screen

### Cutting through fog / noise
Fogcutter, Haze-cutter, Machete, Knife, Scalpel, Signal, Static, Noisegate

### Calibration / Measurement
Gauge, Plumb, Level, Caliper, Compass, Sextant, Yardstick

### “Cleaner thinking” without sanctimony
Clearhead, Lucid, Crisp, Brightline, Untangle, Unknot, Threadpull

### Remedy / antidote vibe (information “poisoning”)
Tonic, Antidote, Detox, Charcoal, Salts, Litmus, Reality Check

### RPG status-cure / potion vibe (playful “take as needed”)
Remedy, Elixir, Potion, Esuna, Cleanse, Purify, Salve, Balm

## 4) Candidate Name List (Grouped)

These are intentionally “too many”; we’ll shortlist later.

### A) Shield / Helm / Hat vibe (defense against info hazards)
- **Aegis** (classic “shield” word; slightly serious)
- **Buckler** (small shield; playful)
- **SlopShield** (says the job; very memeable)
- **SignalShield** (cleaner/less memey than slop)
- **NoiseShield** (audio-ish, but works)
- **MindHelm** (protective helm; slightly sci-fi)
- **ThinkHelm** (clear; might feel “tryhard”)
- **Visor** (simple; implies “seeing clearly”)
- **LucidVisor** (a bit long but evocative)
- **ClearCap** (short; “cap” = hat; friendly)
- **Hardhat** (too construction-coded?)
- **Umbrella** (already a mega-brand; but the metaphor is good)

### B) Filter / sieve / winnow vibe (separating signal from slop)
- **Sift** (very short; strong verb; good CLI: `sift analyze`)
- **Sifter** (friendlier noun form)
- **SlopSieve** (playful + clear)
- **SignalSieve** (less memey)
- **Winnow** (pretty; implies separating wheat/chaff)
- **ChaffCutter** (funny; but longer + ambiguous)
- **Screen** (too generic / UI collision)
- **Decant** (elegant; implies careful separation)

### C) Cut-through-fog vibe (active clarity)
- **FogCutter** (strong metaphor)
- **HazeCutter** (similar)
- **NoiseKnife** (weird but memorable)
- **SignalKnife** (cleaner than noise)
- **StaticMachete** (funny; too long)
- **SlopSlicer** (playful)

### D) Calibration / instrument vibe (serious but not sanctimonious)
- **Plumb** (truth-by-alignment metaphor; short)
- **Level** (simple; lots of collisions)
- **Caliper** (nice tool metaphor; longer)
- **Gauge** (short; generic)
- **Compass** (common; good vibe)
- **Yardstick** (clear; a bit long)

### E) “Clear thinking” vibe (minimal metaphor)
- **Clearhead** (exactly the pitch)
- **Lucid** (simple + positive)
- **Crisp** (very short; maybe too generic)
- **Untangle** (good verb; longer)
- **Brightline** (already used in policy contexts)
- **Unknot** (cute)

### F) Remedy / antidote vibe (information poisoning / “take as needed”)
- **Tonic** (highly verbable; likely name collisions)
- **Antidote** (direct; a bit serious)
- **Detox** (very short; has “wellness detox” baggage)
- **Charcoal** (activated charcoal vibe; “run it through Charcoal” works)
- **Salts** (smelling salts vibe; snaps you awake)
- **Litmus** (already implies “test”; very verbable)
- **RealityCheck** (extremely clear; generic + slightly “overclaim” coded)
- **SanityCheck** (idiomatic + verbable; watch mental-health vibes)

### G) RPG status-cure / potion vibe (8-bit icon in your head)
- **Remedy** (cures “all statuses”; very verbable; works for gamers + non-gamers)
- **Elixir** (classic “full restore”; maybe slightly fantasy-coded but common)
- **Potion** (ultra-generic, but ultra-clear; possible collisions)
- **Esuna** (FF spell; fun sound; more niche)
- **Cleanse** (common game verb; clear meaning)
- **Purify** (similar to cleanse; a bit more moralizing vibe)
- **Salve** (short; “salve it” verbs well)
- **Balm** (soft, soothing; may undersell “rigor”)

## 5) First-Pass Shortlist (14)

Not final; just a starting point to react to.

1. **Remedy**
1. **Sift**
2. **Aegis**
3. **Buckler**
4. **SlopShield**
5. **SlopSieve**
6. **FogCutter**
7. **Clearhead**
8. **Lucid**
9. **Visor**
10. **Plumb**
11. **Tonic**
12. **RealityCheck**
13. **Elixir**
14. **Litmus**

## 6) Taglines (Optional)

If the name is abstract (e.g., “Sift”), a tagline can carry the meaning:
- “A framework for claim extraction, evaluation, and synthesis.”
- “See what a source *actually* says; test what it implies.”
- “Anti-slop thinking tools for messy information environments.”
- “Wade through noise. Keep the claims.”

## 7) Next Steps (How To Choose)

1. Pick **3 vibe finalists** (e.g., one from Shield/Helm, one from Sieve/Filter, one from Clearhead/Lucid).
2. Say them out loud in sentences:
   - “I ran this through **X**.”
   - “**X** flagged the weak links.”
   - “Open the **X** workflow.”
3. Quick collision checks:
   - GitHub repo name availability
   - Package index name (PyPI) if relevant
   - Obvious trademarks / major products
4. Decide whether to split:
   - serious umbrella + playful CLI (or vice versa)
